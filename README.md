	This portfolio website was created for the Javascript Frameworks course at Georgian College in June of 2022.
	The project was created using Node.js and Express.js.
	Here is a list of all packages used on the project:
-	Nodemon – live server refresh / hot reload
-	HandleBars
-	Bootstrap – used to stylize components. I’ve used the menubar, cards, in between others.
-	Font awesome – used to show the github and linkedin icons on footer
-	Nodemailer – package that sends contact form information to e-mail. I used the correspondent npm package and followed the instructions on how to write the code.
